# concurrentuserservice

1.  Project Scaffolding and Setup

    Initialize Project: Use the Spring Initializr to generate a new Spring Boot project.

    Select Dependencies: Include the following starters:

        Spring Web: For building the RESTful API endpoints.

        Spring Boot DevTools: For automatic restarts during development.

        Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code (like getters, setters, and constructors) in model classes.

        Validation: For declarative validation of request data.

2.  Domain Modeling

    Define the User Model: Create a User class with the required fields: id (unique identifier), name, and email.

    Add Constraints: Use Jakarta Bean Validation annotations (e.g., @NotNull, @Email, @Size) on the model fields to enforce data integrity rules.

3.  Data Storage and Access (In-Memory)

    Choose Data Structure: Select a thread-safe data structure for storing users. A ConcurrentHashMap<Long, User> is ideal for this, as it allows for safe concurrent reads and writes.

    Plan ID Generation: Design a mechanism for generating unique, sequential user IDs. An AtomicLong is the perfect tool for ensuring thread-safe ID increments.

4.  Service Layer Design

    Define the UserService Interface: Create an interface to define the contract for user management operations. This promotes loose coupling and makes the system easier to test and extend later (e.g., switching to a database implementation).

    Specify CRUD Methods: Outline the core methods in the interface:

        createUser(CreateUserRequest request)

        getUserById(Long id)

        getAllUsers()

        updateUser(Long id, UpdateUserRequest request)

        deleteUser(Long id)

    Implement the Service: Create a UserServiceImpl class that implements the UserService interface. This class will contain the business logic and interact with the in-memory data store.

5.  API Layer (Controller)

    Design REST Endpoints: Plan the RESTful API endpoints in a UserController. Map the CRUD operations to standard HTTP methods:

        POST /api/users: Create a new user.

        GET /api/users/{id}: Retrieve a single user.

        GET /api/users: Retrieve a list of all users.

        PUT /api/users/{id}: Update an existing user.

        DELETE /api/users/{id}: Delete a user.

    Define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Create separate request/response classes (e.g., CreateUserRequest, UserResponse) to decouple the API layer from the internal domain model. This provides flexibility and security.

6.  Error and Exception Handling

    Create Custom Exceptions: Define specific, custom exceptions to represent business errors, such as:

        UserNotFoundException

        EmailAlreadyExistsException

    Implement a Global Exception Handler: Use a class annotated with @ControllerAdvice to centralize exception handling. This will catch the custom exceptions from the service layer and translate them into appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict) and consistent JSON error responses.

7.  Testing Strategy

    Unit Tests: Plan unit tests for the UserServiceImpl class. The goal is to test the business logic in isolation.

        Verify user creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion.

        Test edge cases, such as attempting to retrieve a non-existent user.

        Ensure that appropriate exceptions are thrown for invalid operations (e.g., creating a user with a duplicate email).

    Integration Tests: Plan integration tests for the UserController class. The goal is to test the full request-response cycle.

        Use MockMvc to send simulated HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

        Assert that the correct HTTP status codes are returned.

        Verify the content of the JSON responses.

        Check the state of the in-memory store after operations.

    Concurrency Tests (Optional but Recommended): Outline a simple test case to verify thread safety by having multiple threads attempt to create or modify users concurrently.

8.  Containerization with Docker

    This application is configured to be built and run as a Docker container.

    **Prerequisites:**
    - Docker must be installed and running on your system.

    **Building the Docker Image:**

    Open a terminal in the project root directory and run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker build -t concurrentuserservice .
    ```

    This command will build a Docker image named `concurrentuserservice` using the provided `Dockerfile`.

    **Running the Docker Container:**

    Once the image is built, you can run the application in a container with this command:

    ```sh
    docker run -p 8080:8080 concurrentuserservice
    ```

    This will start the container and map port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 inside the container. The service will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
